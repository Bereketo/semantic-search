# Movie Search with FAISS and Streamlit

Welcome to my project! This is a simple tool I built to search through a movie dataset using FAISS for fast similarity search, all wrapped up in a neat Streamlit app.

## What's Inside?

- **Semantic Search**: Type in a movie title, genre, or anything else, and find similar movies.
- **Speedy Results**: Thanks to FAISS, the search is super fastâ€”even with large datasets.
- **Easy Interface**: The Streamlit UI is straightforward and user-friendly.

## What You'll Need

- Python 3.7+
- FAISS (for search)
- Streamlit (for the web app)
- Sentence Transformers (for generating embeddings)
- Pandas and NumPy (for data handling)

## How to Get Started

1. **Clone the Repo**  
   First, grab the code from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/semantic-search-faiss.git
   cd semantic-search
   ```
2. **Set up your Environment**
   I recommend using a virtual environment
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate 
   ```
3. **Install the necessary requirements**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   streamlit  app.py  or python -m streamlit run app.py
   ```
